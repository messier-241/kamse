        <h1>My Religion and Beliefs</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="otherthings">
        <p>I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses.<br> I don't celebrate such things like Christmas, Easter, Birthdays among others.<br>
             This is because we believe that these celebrations have pegan origins and aren't in harmony with God's standards.
